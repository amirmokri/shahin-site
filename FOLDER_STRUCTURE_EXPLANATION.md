# Folder Structure & Media Upload Explanation

## 📁 **Static vs Staticfiles Folders**

### **`static/` folder (Source Files)** ✅ **KEEP**
```
static/
├── css/                    # Your custom CSS files
├── js/                     # Your custom JavaScript files  
├── images/                 # Your website images (logo, favicon, etc.)
├── fontawesome/           # FontAwesome files
├── media/                 # Media upload structure
│   ├── lectures/          # Where lecture images go
│   ├── services/          # Where service images go
│   ├── services/videos/   # Where service videos go
│   ├── bonus/             # Where bonus images go
│   └── site/              # Where site images go
└── robots.txt
```

**Purpose**: Source files that Django collects and processes

### **`staticfiles/` folder (Collected Files)** ✅ **KEEP**
```
staticfiles/
├── admin/                 # Django admin static files
├── css/                   # Collected CSS files
├── js/                    # Collected JavaScript files
├── images/                # Collected images
├── fontawesome/           # Collected FontAwesome files
├── media/                 # Collected media files (from uploads)
│   ├── lectures/          # Actual uploaded lecture images
│   ├── services/          # Actual uploaded service images
│   ├── services/videos/   # Actual uploaded service videos
│   ├── bonus/             # Actual uploaded bonus images
│   └── site/              # Actual uploaded site images
├── rest_framework/        # Django REST framework files
└── robots.txt
```

**Purpose**: Final destination for `collectstatic` command - gets uploaded to Arvan Cloud

## 🔄 **How Media Upload Works**

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Admin Upload**:
   ```
   User uploads image in admin panel
   ↓
   Django saves to: staticfiles/media/lectures/image.jpg
   ```

2. **Collectstatic Command**:
   ```
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ↓
   Collects ALL files from static/ + staticfiles/media/
   ↓
   Uploads to Arvan Cloud bucket under 'static/' prefix
   ```

3. **Final Result**:
   ```
   Arvan Cloud bucket:
   ├── static/css/...
   ├── static/js/...
   ├── static/images/...
   ├── static/media/lectures/image.jpg  ← Your uploaded image
   ├── static/media/services/image.jpg  ← Your uploaded image
   └── static/media/site/hero.jpg       ← Site images
   ```

## 🌐 **URL Generation**

### **In Templates:**
```html
<!-- Lecture image -->
{{ lecture.image.url }}
<!-- Generates: https://bucket.arvanstorage.com/static/media/lectures/image.jpg -->

<!-- Service image -->
{{ service.image.url }}
<!-- Generates: https://bucket.arvanstorage.com/static/media/services/image.jpg -->

<!-- Site hero image -->
{{ site_settings.hero_image.url }}
<!-- Generates: https://bucket.arvanstorage.com/static/media/site/hero.jpg -->
```

## ✅ **Answer to Your Questions**

### **Q1: Will uploaded images go to Arvan Object Storage?**
**A: YES!** 
- Admin uploads → `staticfiles/media/`
- `collectstatic` → Uploads to Arvan Cloud
- Final URL: `https://bucket.arvanstorage.com/static/media/...`

### **Q2: Which folders are needed for Arvan Object Storage?**
**A: BOTH folders are needed:**

#### **For Static Files (CSS, JS, Images):**
- `static/` → Source files
- `staticfiles/` → Collected files (uploaded to Arvan)

#### **For Media Files (Uploads):**
- `static/media/` → Folder structure for uploads
- `staticfiles/media/` → Actual uploaded files (uploaded to Arvan)

## 🚀 **Deployment Process**

1. **Deploy code** to server
2. **Run migrations**: `python manage.py migrate`
3. **Collect static files**: `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput`
   - This uploads ALL files (static + media) to Arvan Cloud
4. **Test uploads**: Upload image in admin panel
5. **Verify**: Check Arvan Cloud bucket for new files

## 📊 **Folder Summary**

| Folder | Purpose | Keep? | Arvan Upload? |
